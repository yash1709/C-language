/*  #define and #include Preprocessor Directives : #59

*** #include:-
In the C Programming, the '#include' directive causes the pre-processor to fetch the contents of another file into the source code. It will add the content at the point where the #include directive is found. The #include directive is typically used to include the C header files for the C functions that are held outside of the current source file.

A header file is a file which contains the extension ".h". This extension has C macro definitions and C function declarations to be shared between several source files.

Header files are of two types :
1)  files that the programmer writes
2)  files that come with the compiler.

We request to use a header file in our program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like as we have seen the stdio.h header file, which comes along with the compiler.


Syntax:-
The syntax for the #include directive is :
#include
The #include tells the compiler to look for the directory where system header files are held.

OR

#include "header file."
The #include "header file" tells the compiler to look in the current directory from where the program is running.


Note : If a header file is included within the symbol <>, the pre-processor will search a predetermined directory path to locate the header file. If the header file is enclosed in quotation mark " ", the pre-processor will look for the header file in the same directory as the source file.






*** #define:-
In the C Programming, The #define pre-processor directive is used to define pre-processor variable, constant or macro. Macro operate much like functions. The #define can use any basic data type. This pre-processor directive can be used to replace a word with a number globally. It acts as if an editor did a global search-and-replace edit of the file.

We can use the #define directive for the debugging purpose. We can have print statements that will be only active while debugging.



Syntax:-
The syntax for using #define in the C language is :
#define constant_name value

OR

#define constant_name (expression)

Constant_name : The name of the constant.
Value : The value of the constant.
Expression : It is an expression whose value is assigned to the constant. The expression must be enclosed in parentheses if it contains any operators.



The following is an example of a #define directive to define a numeric constant:

#define Max_length 10
#define Area_OF_Circle(r) (3.1415*(r)*(r))
In this example, the constant named Max_length would contain the value of 10.


#include
#define PI 3.14
main() {
printf("%f",PI);
}
Output: 3.140000



Beware of two common errors while using the #defines. The most common error is adding extra characters that don't belong.
For Example :
#define MAXARRAYSIZE = 100 //incorrect
#define MAXARRAYSIZE 100;//correct
