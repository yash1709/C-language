/*  Predefined Macros & Other Pre-processor Directives : #60

Let's start preprocessor directives as we have already covered #define and #include in the previous tutorial. In this, we will move forward to a few others :


1)  #undef:
As can be guessed by the name, it is used to undefine a macro to eliminate its definition.

Example :
#define E 1111
#undef E
E is not defined for any value after using #undef, so it holds no value in the above example.



2)  #ifdef:
It is used to check whether a macro is defined or not. If it is defined, then it executes the code.

Example :
#ifdef M                    //execute code if true i.e., the macro is defined



3)  #ifndef:
It works exactly the opposite of 'ifdef'. Meaning that it executes the code if the macro is undefined.

Example :
#ifdef M                     //execute code if true i.e., the macro is defined



4)  #if:
It checks whether the given condition is true or not. If true, then it executes the code.

Example :
#if condition                // execute code if true i.e. condition satisfied



5)  #else:
If the condition of ‚Äòif‚Äô is false, then the else is executed.

Example :
#if condition               
// execute code if true else pass it to #else

#else 
// execute code if ‚Äúif condition‚Äù is false



6)  #elif:
It is used to insert more conditions between if and else. If the ‚Äúif statement‚Äù is true, then elif won‚Äôt be checked.

Example :
#if condition 
// execute code if true else pass it to #elif

#elif expression 
// execute code if true else pass it to #else

#else 
//else code



7)  #pragma:
Pragma is used to issue some special commands to compiler.

/*  
Let's discuss some pre-defined macros now. A pre-defined macro is a macro that has already been defined or understood by C preprocessor and does not need a definition.


1) __DATE__:
It prints the current date on to the screen. The date format it follows is MMMDDYYY.

Syntax :
#include 
int main()
{
printf( __DATE__);
return 0;
}

Output : Sep 15 2020
Note : The output will be the current date.



2) __TIME__:
It prints the current time on to the screen. The date format it follows is HH:MM:SS.

Syntax :
#include 
int main()
{
printf( __TIME__);
return 0;
}

Output : 17:15:20
Note : The output will be the current time.



3) __FILE__:
It prints the current file name on to the screen. The name will be printed as a string literal.

Syntax :
#include 
int main()
{
printf( __FILE__);
return 0;
}

Output : main.c



4) __LINE__:
It prints the current line number on to the screen. The number will be printed as a decimal constant.

Syntax :
#include 
int main()
{
printf( ‚Äú%d‚Äù__LINE__);
return 0;
}

Output : 4



5) __STDC__:
It is used to check whether our program is being compiler using ANSI standard or not. It will return 1 if true.

Syntax :
#include 
int main()
{
printf("%d\n", __STDC__);
return 0;
}

Output : 1
