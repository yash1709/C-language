/* Why is Recursion not always good ?
Iterative approach takes less time as in case of Fibonacci Series it doesnâ€™t call same no. again and again but in Recursive approach it calls same no. again and again i.e. many times.

Recursion is a good approach when it comes to problem solving.
However, programmer needs to evaluate the need and impact of using recursive/iterative approach while solving a particular problem.
In case of Factorial calculation, recursion saved a lot of lines of code.
However in case of Fibonacci Series recursive approach called many functions again and again causing time waste.
