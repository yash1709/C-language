/*  File I/O In C : #62

*** Purpose of files in C :
Files are used to store content hence reducing the program's size.
We can read or access data from files.
The data in files remain stored even after the program's execution is terminated.
Files are stored in non-volatile memory. To understand what a non-volatile memory is, we have to see the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory.


            VOLATILE MEMORY                                         NON- VOLATILE MEMORY
The data can only remain in it while the computer’s power is on.  The data will also be present in it while the computer’s power is off.
Can only hold information when having a constant power supply     Can also hold information, in case of inconstant power supply
Will hold data for a short period.                                Will hold data for a long term.
RAM is an example                                                 Hard Disk is an example.


    So due to the above differences, we can conclude the reasons we need files.


*** Types of Files
There are two types of files :

1)  Binary Files
2)  Text Files


1)  Binary Files:
Binary files stores data in 01 i.e., binary format.
They are not directly readable.
An application or software is required to read binary files.
An example is a .doc file.


2)  Text Files:
They store data in simple text format.
They are directly readable.
No software is required to access them.
An example is a .txt file.
