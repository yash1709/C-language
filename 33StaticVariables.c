*** Local Variables :
Local variables are declared inside a function or a block of code; they cannot be accessed outside the function.
The system does not initialize local variables, we must initialize it ourself.
The scope of these variables will be within the function only.


*** Global Variables :
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually in the main.
Global variables hold their values, and we can access them inside any of the functions defined for the program.
Global variables are initialized by the system automatically when we define them.


NOTE :
@   If the local and global variables have the same name, the local variable will take preference.



*** Formal Parameters :
Formal parameters have precedence over global variables, and they are treated as local variables within a function.
The term formal parameters are used to refer to the parameters in the definition of the method.



//  What is a static variable?
A static variable is known to retain the value even after they exit the scope.
Static variables retain their value and are not initialized again in the new scope.
The static variable until the end of the program is kept in the memory, whereas a normal variable is destroyed when a function is over.
They can be defined inside or outside the function.
The default value of static variables is zero.
The keyword 'static' is used to declare a static variable.


Syntax:
static Datatype Variable_name = Variable_value;

datatype ‚àí The data type of variable like char, int, float, etc.
variable_name ‚àí This is the name of the variable.
Variable_value ‚àí Value to initialize the variable. By default, it is zero.



// Example:-

#include <stdio.h>

int myfunc()
{
    static int i = 0;
    i++;
    return i;
}

int main()
{
    printf("Value:%d", myfunc());
    printf("\nValue:%d", myfunc());

    return 0;
}

Output:-

    Value:1
    Value:2



*** Differences between static local and the static global variable
Static global variable :
If we declare the variable with a 'static' keyword outside the function, then it is known as a static global variable. This variable will be accessible throughout the program.

Static local variable :
When a variable with a 'static' keyword is declared inside a function is known as a static local variable.
The scope of the static local variable will be the same as the local variables, but its memory will be available throughout the execution of the program.



*** Properties of a static variable :
Static variable memory is allocated within a static variable.
A static variable will retain the value even after they exit the scope.
Static variable memory is available throughout the program.
If we do not assign any value to the static variable, then the default value will be 0.
